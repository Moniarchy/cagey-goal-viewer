Knowing how to change the colors of a page or app allows for that interactivity and even accessibility for certain users who might need to increase the contrast between the text and background fonts/colors of their own volition. Someone who takes on this project will have to think about the following:\r\n\r\n- What are the base colors for the page?\r\n- When does the page change? Depending on a person's name? The first letter of their name? The time of day when they access the app? Or with some other factor?\r\n- Does the user choose the colors they can change the page to, or is it a preset by the creator of the page? \r\n- What are the different functions in Javascript that can be used to achieve the specifications?\r\n\r\n## Specifications\r\n\r\n- [ ] Using HTML and CSS, create at least one web page with information on it for a user to read. This could be a current event, a short story, an instruction set, or an about me page, for example.\r\n- [ ] Using Javascript, create a function that allows the text color and the page background color to be changed according to the factors that the creator sets forth.\r\n- [ ] If the user chooses the colors that the page can be, make buttons for the user to choose or cycle through available sets of colors.\r\n- [ ] If the creator of the page does not allow the user to change the colors, create an alert that logs an answer and uses the user's response in order to change the colors.\r\n\r\n### Required\r\n\r\n_Do not remove these specs - they are required for all goals_.\r\n\r\n- [ ] The artifact produced is properly licensed, preferably with the [MIT license][mit-license].\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<!-- LICENSE -->\r\n\r\n<a rel=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\"><img alt=\"Creative Commons License\" style=\"border-width:0\" src=\"https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-nc-sa/4.0/80x15.png\" /></a>\r\n<br />This work is licensed under a <a rel=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\">Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License</a>.\r\n\r\n[mit-license]: https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT\r\n"

    "body": "# Description\r\n\r\nCreate a link database with different methods for organization and sharing. Store & share learning resources, tutorials, good videos, etc.\r\n\r\nThe interface for this app will be a HTTP API that serves JSON. There will also be a minimal web UI for account creation and management.\r\n\r\nFor example, if a user wanted to get all of their links tagged with `javascript`, they may issue the following HTTP request:\r\n\r\n```shell-session\r\n$ curl -X GET http://www.app.url/myUsername/links?tag=javascript&token=myAuthToken\r\n```\r\n\r\n...and get a JSON response looking like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[\r\n  {\r\n    \"url\": \"https://davidwalsh.name/es6-generators\",\r\n    \"createdOn\": \"Thu Jul 14 14:21:01 EDT 2016\",\r\n    \"tags\": [\r\n      \"javascript\",\r\n      \"generators\",\r\n      \"es6\"\r\n    ]\r\n  },\r\n  {\r\n    \"url\": \"https://github.com/adam-s/js-interview-review\",\r\n    \"createdOn\": \"Mon Jul 11 08:21:01 EDT 2016\",\r\n    \"tags\": [\r\n      \"javascript\",\r\n      \"interviewing\",\r\n      \"career-prep\"\r\n    ]\r\n  },\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nUse [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/).\r\n\r\n## Context\r\n\r\nBuilding a application programming interface (API) for the web is a great way to learn how they work. In cases where the primary consumers of a piece of software are _other programs_ and not human users, a user interface (UI) is overkill.\r\n\r\nThat doesn't mean that an API can ignore the rules of good design, but it is a different way to think of interface design.\r\n\r\nThere are many examples of apps and APIs similar to this one, so you'll have lots to compare to.\r\n\r\nAs you work on this goal, consider the following questions:\r\n\r\n- What is the most appropriate data model for this app?\r\n- Which requests should be available to all users? Which should require authorization?\r\n- How should different endpoints be structured? Can a RESTful interface be implemented?\r\n\r\n## Specifications\r\nStories:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Users can create an account (web UI)\r\n- [ ] Users can create an auth token (web UI)\r\n- [ ] Users can authenticate HTTP requests with their token\r\n- [ ] Users have their own link library\r\n- [ ] Links can belong to one or more library\r\n- [ ] Links can have one or more tags\r\n- [ ] Links have a title\r\n- [ ] Links have comments\r\n- [ ] Links have a description\r\n- [ ] Links have a creator\r\n- [ ] Users can create links with HTTP POST\r\n- [ ] Users can add a link to their library with HTTP POST\r\n- [ ] Users can get a link by id with HTTP GET\r\n- [ ] Users can update a links in their library with HTTP PUT or PATCH\r\n- [ ] Link title and description can only be updated by the link creator\r\n- [ ] Users can add tags to links\r\n- [ ] Users can comment on links\r\n- [ ] Users can search for links by title with HTTP GET\r\n- [ ] Users can search for links by tag with HTTP GET\r\n\r\nBuild specs:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Site is deployed and live on the web\r\n- [ ] JS source code is written using ECMAScript 2015\r\n- [ ] Client-side JS scripts are compiled using a tool like Babel.js\r\n\r\n### Required\r\n\r\n_Do not remove these specs - they are required for all goals_.\r\n\r\n- [ ] The artifact produced is properly licensed, preferably with the [MIT license][mit-license].\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<!-- LICENSE -->\r\n\r\n<a rel=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\"><img alt=\"Creative Commons License\" style=\"border-width:0\" src=\"https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-nc-sa/4.0/80x15.png\" /></a>\r\n<br />This work is licensed under a <a rel=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\">Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License</a>.\r\n\r\n[mit-license]: https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT\r\n"

High five! 🙌🏽\r\n\r\nTo complete this goal, you'll create a Node.js module that exports two functions: one to encode a string of alphanumeric characters into emoji, and another to decode an emoji message to the original string.\r\n\r\nHere's an example usage:\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nimport {encode, decode} from \"emoji-cipher\"\r\n\r\nencode(\"secret message\")\r\n// => \"😸🏃🐴👿🏃🤓 🐥🏃😸😸🌵🌎🏃\"\r\n\r\ndecode(\"😸🏃🐴👿🏃🤓 🐥🏃😸😸🌵🌎🏃\")\r\n// => \"secret message\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you're not familiar with Node.js and/or ECMAScript 2015, you'll need to do some research to become familiar with these technologies. For compiling, consider using [Babel](https://babeljs.io/).\r\n\r\n## Context\r\n\r\nA cipher is \"a secret or disguised way of writing; a code\" (source: [Google](https://www.google.com/#q=cipher)). Technically, a cipher is a mapping between two sets of symbols.\r\n\r\nOne of the earliest and simplest ciphers in history is something you may have played with as a child: a [Caesar cipher](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caesar_cipher).\r\n\r\nTranslating between different representations of data is a such a common task in programming, and a cipher is a good (and fun) way to become familiar with this process.\r\n\r\nAs you work on this goal, consider the following questions:\r\n\r\n- What does it mean to encode or decode something? Where else are these processes used?\r\n- Which characters will the cipher support? How will the _mapping_ between characters and emoji be represented?\r\n- How should the functions respond to invalid input? What are the possible errors and how should they be handled?\r\n\r\n## Specifications\r\n\r\n- [ ] Code is packaged as a module that exports (at least) the two functions `encode` and `decode`.\r\n- [ ] Exported functions can encode and decode alphanumeric characters to/from emoji.\r\n- [ ] Tests for both `encode` and `decode` functions are included and passing.\r\n- [ ] All source code is written using ECMAScript 2015 syntax.\r\n- [ ] Source code contains a `README.md` file with instructions and example usage.\r\n\r\n### Required\r\n\r\n_Do not remove these specs - they are required for all goals_.\r\n\r\n- [ ] The artifact produced is properly licensed, preferably with the [MIT license][mit-license].\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<!-- LICENSE -->\r\n\r\n<a rel=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\"><img alt=\"Creative Commons License\" style=\"border-width:0\" src=\"https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-nc-sa/4.0/80x15.png\" /></a>\r\n<br />This work is licensed under a <a rel=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\">Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License</a>.\r\n\r\n[mit-license]: https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT\r\n"

Then, design and build a new site for the organization. You can use the same content (text and images) to populate the site, but come up with a different design.\r\n\r\nIf the site you pick has more than 3 pages, aim to build at least 3 of the most important pages (e.g. \"Home\", \"About\", \"Contact\").\r\n\r\n## Context\r\n\r\nA common job for web designers and developers working in consultancies or as freelancers is to redesign an existing site.

    "body": "## Description\r\n\r\nA portfolio website is a great way to showcase your work as a developer. It also doesn't need to be too complicated: a simple static page with links to projects will do just fine.\r\n\r\nUsing [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/), you can publish the site on the web for free.\r\n\r\nThere are lots of good resources on the web to support development of a site like this. For a full tutorial covering the skills you'll need to complete this goal, try the curriculum on [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.com/) leading up to their [Personal Portfolio Webpage](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-personal-portfolio-webpage), especially the HTML5 and CSS section.\r\n\r\nIdeally, each member of your team produces their own site and you all collaborate on every site together. However, if that seems like too much, then pick just one or two team members to build a portfolio site for.\r\n\r\n## Context\r\n\r\nBuilding a simple HTML and CSS \"from scratch\" is a great way to learn just how powerful these two technologies are, and how to wield them well.\r\n\r\nWhile in most websites you'll be using external libraries, templates, and frameworks, sometimes these tools can hinder real understanding and cause confusion about what HTML and CSS are capable of on their own.\r\n\r\nThis does not at all mean that you can't look at libraries and frameworks (like [Pure](http://purecss.io/)) for inspiration and example—by all means do so! Feel free to use anything on the internet as inspiration to help you solve the particular problem you encounter.\r\n\r\nAs you code your site, you will likely encounter questions such as:\r\n\r\n- How can a web page be organized into columns, rows, and other basic layout features?\r\n- What are all the different HTML tags and how should they be used?\r\n- Why should websites be \"responsive\" and how do they become so?\r\n\r\n## Specifications\r\n\r\n- [ ] Every site is published and visible on the web.\r\n- [ ] Visitors to each site can read information about the author.\r\n- [ ] Visitors to each site can see a list of projects (fine to use fake projects as placeholders).\r\n- [ ] No external CSS libraries or frameworks are used—all CSS is written from scratch.\r\n- [ ] No HTML templates are used—all HTML is written from scratch.\r\n- [ ] All links work correctly (i.e. no broken links).\r\n- [ ] All images and other external resources load correctly.\r\n\r\n### Required\r\n\r\n_Do not remove these specs - they are required for all goals_.\r\n\r\n- [ ] The artifact produced is properly licensed, preferably with the [MIT license][mit-license].\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n<!-- LICENSE -->\r\n\r\n<a rel=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\"><img alt=\"Creative Commons License\" style=\"border-width:0\" src=\"https://i.creativecommons.org/l/by-nc-sa/4.0/80x15.png\" /></a>\r\n<br />This work is licensed under a <a rel=\"license\" href=\"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/\">Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike 4.0 International License</a>.\r\n\r\n[mit-license]: https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT\r\n"
